I'm currently working at Uber as an self driving technology engineer and wrapping up my pjs thesis. Before that I worked at Airbus on cockpit concepts and Virtual Reality as well as as a Graduate Researcher and Robotics PhD candidate at Georgia Tech School of Aerospace, working on adaptive controls for semi-autonomous cars as well as collaborative artificial intelligence for future commercial aviation cockpits.

During my curriculum, I worked for two and a half years at Airbus Group Innovations in Munich, Germany, developing cockpit / flight automation concepts and evaluating them using Virtual Reality experiments. Before that, I received a M.S in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech and a Diplome d'Ingenieur from Supaero (France) in 2013.

My PhD thesis work focuses on computational modeling of safe and efficient Human-AI collaboration. Potential applications of my research span from flight deck automation to integration of adaptive controls in semi-automated cars.

My fields of expertise and interests include Human Factors, Controls, Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. Private pilot since 2013, I'm a big soccer fan, practice astronomy and contribute to open source projects.
