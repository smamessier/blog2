  A summary of my practice of astronomy and astrophotography
---

I enjoy practicing astronomy and astro-photography. I see it as a way to experience the communion of science and nature, directly with my own eyes or through mirrors and lenses.
Astro photography is a slightly more demanding hobby as it requires good tracking and image processing capabilities.
A good hike if often required to find a good observation spot which is also part of the fun.

I used Astronomy at higher scientific level twice, once for an exoplanet detection project about which I started writing [a blog post](/chasing-exoplanets/) and the next year as a research project at Supaero to detect asteroids crashing on the Moon.
