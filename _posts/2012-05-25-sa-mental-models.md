This project aims to answer some general questions about the evolution of mental representations of systems and their environment using statistical methods. We used mini-games to design a human experiment and evaluate hypotheses about the evolution of mental models and the impact of workload on situation awareness. The statistical analysis proved several significant interactions between workload and situation awareness and meaningful insight regarding the alteration of mental models. We believe this work can provide a solid experimental basis to support the development of more realistic human agent models.
