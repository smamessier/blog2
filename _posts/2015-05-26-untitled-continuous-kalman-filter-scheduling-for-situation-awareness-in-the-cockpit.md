Ongoing research in Cognitive Engineering proposes to model an ideal pilot as an optimal state estimator. Control theory tackled the problem of optimally scheduling the allocation of sensors to track multiple correlated targets, using results from operations research. Combining the findings of both disciplines could help with providing a quantitative indicator for best-case performance of the flight crew as a result of the interaction of the aircraft/auto-flight system dynamics, physiological constraints, cockpit interfaces and pilot monitoring patterns. This project investigates the addition of realistic human-related constraints derived from experimental pilot studies and geometrical constraints on the cost function used in the Kalman filter scheduling problem.
