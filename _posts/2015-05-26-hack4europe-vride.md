Hacked in 3 week ends, I coded VRide together with Gregoire Deprez, the goal was to enhance Uber/Lift rides with Augmented Reality experiences. More like a proof of concept, it got use familiarized with Vuforia, AR markers, OpenGL, WebGL, CSS3D and Uber APIs.

The video is slightly laggy (available hardware was slighty insufficient, we should try again with newer smartphones!), but gives a good impression of the concept !
