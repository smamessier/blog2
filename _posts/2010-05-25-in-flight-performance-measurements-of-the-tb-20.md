This project was very exciting as we performed in-flight performance measurement while maneuvering the TB-20 around the Lasbordes airfield. The school TB-20 is equipped with additional aerodynamic and inertial sensors. 
The report is in french, I don't have time right now to translate it into english, it's quite easy to understand for people with flight dynamics background as it handles classical measurements:

* Calibration of altimeter and airspeed indicator (Altimètre, anémomètre)
* Climb rate calculation (Taux de montée)
* Leveled acceleleration (Accélération en palier)
* Stalling, buffeting

Here is the full report presentation:
